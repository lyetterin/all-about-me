<h3>Bahamian | She/Her | English Lit, Book Design, & Media Literacy Nerd | Visual Communicator</h3>
	<p>I am <i>entirely</i> made of flaws stitched together with <strong>good intentions</strong>.</p>
<p>I've always been fascinated and passionate about design. I have experience in decorating cakes and cupcakes. Recently, I've channeled my design skills to book design, graphic design, and storefront design. I graduated with a B.A. in English Literature and Publishing with minors in Economics, Entrepreneurship, Marketing, Small Business Management, and Sociology from Hastings College. Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in English Literature at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p>
